    Indicates that a variable needs to be reduced into a single value or single 
    set of values (e.g. an array) at the end of a parallelized loop. This is 
    usually the case when some value that's shared across the parititons is used
    that needs to be combined on completions. An example of this is the count
    and count_if algorithms.
    
    Var is the variable that the reduction should be performed on, RedTy is the
    type of reduction the compiler should perform and OpTy is the operator if 
    there is any that should be used when reducing.
    
    You can wrap it around the variable inside the loop or outside of it, but it
    will come at a cost if you wrap it around something inside the loop as it'll
    be another layer of calculations that the compiler needs to do (it'll have 
    to "execute" the function every loop iteration), even if it is essenitally a
    NoOp.
